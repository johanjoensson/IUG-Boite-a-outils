These are the source files for all student made procedures, if you can't use them you probably shouldn't have downloaded them.

To download simpl use:
git clone git://github.com/johanjoensson/IUG-Boite-a-outils.git 

Afterwards you should only need to use
git pull

in order to get the latest updates.


I consider Polygone, Polyline and Drawline to be finished from now on, changes may be commited, but the focus from now on will be user interaction.

If you want to make changes and contribute to the code then send me the files containing your changes and I will add them to the repository. 
If you want to be able to commit changes directly to the repository yourself then contact me and maybe I can add your ssh-key so that you can upload files yourself.
